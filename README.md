### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a senior at Indiana Tech, working on my Bachelor's in CS. When I'm not
learning full time at school or working part time at Aptera, I write blog posts about
things that I find interesting and create cool open source projects, free for everyone
to use!

#### Here's some awesome stuff I'm working on:

- [`transmute`][2] - An alchemical refactoring extension for JavaScript.
- [`garbonzo`][8] - An interaction layer for better management of GitHub issues and pull
  requests. 
- [`rolomem`][3] - An embedded membership barcode keeper built using the Raspberry Pi
  Pico. 
- [`continuous-releases`][4] - A GitHub Action that helps automate releases with semver
  tagging and auto-generated changelogs.

#### Like what I do?

[Consider sponsoring me][1]! Open source development is a passion of mine, but it takes
time. Sponsoring me is the best way to help me devote more time to my projects!
  
#### Looking for some of my older projects?

- [`sauron`][5] - A utility for searching for packages on the AUR.
- [`pep9-asm`][6] - Language support for the Pep/9 assembly language in VS Code.
- [`react-context-stateful`][7] - A simple wrapper that makes it easy to create stateful
  contexts.
