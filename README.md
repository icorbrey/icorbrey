### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a senior at Indiana Tech, working on my Bachelor's in CS. When I'm not
learning full time at school or working part time at Aptera, I write blog posts about
things that I find interesting and create cool open source projects, free for everyone
to use!

#### Here's some awesome stuff I'm working on:

**[`icorbrey/transmute`][repo-transmute]** - An alchemical refactoring extension for JavaScript.  
**[`icorbrey/rolomem`][repo-rolomem]** - An embedded membership barcode keeper built using the Raspberry Pi Pico.  
**[`icorbrey/garbonzo`][repo-garbonzo]** - An interaction layer for better management of GitHub issues and pull requests.  
**[`icorbrey/continuous-releases`][repo-continuous-releases]** - A GitHub Action that helps automate releases with semver tagging and auto-generated changelogs.

#### Like what I do?

[Consider sponsoring me][sponsor-profile]! Open source development is a passion of mine, but it takes
time. Sponsoring me is the best way to help me devote more time to my projects!
  
#### Looking for some of my older projects?

**[`icorbrey/sauron`][repo-sauron]** - A utility for searching for packages on the AUR.  
**[`icorbrey/pep9-asm`][repo-pep9-asm]** - Language support for the Pep/9 assembly language in VS Code.  
**[`icorbrey/react-context-stateful`][repo-react-context-stateful]** - A simple wrapper that makes it easy to create stateful
  contexts.
